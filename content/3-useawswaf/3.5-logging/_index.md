#### Situation
The Juice Shop is growing rapidly. Great work! Now that you have a set of rules, it is becoming more difficult to reason which rule is responsible for blocking a request. It would be helpful to have some logs. To do this, you need to enable logging for your Web ACL to an S3 Bucket. Your logs contain a sensitive header, named Cookie. You donâ€™t want this to be stored in your logs. You will need configure the redaction of this header in the logs.

#### Log the requests
{{% notice info %}} 
WAF Uses [Amazon Kinesis Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/) to ingest logs. This allows logs to be passed to any Kinesis Firehose destination, such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift or Amazon Elastic Search. To enable logging of requests in your Web ACL, you must first create a Kinesis Data Firehose.

#### Conclusion
WAF allows you to capture request logs and store them in any Kinesis Data Firehose destination. The logs provide information of the request. The logs also provide the action and rule involved for a request. This information can be invaluable when running a WAF. Use field redaction to avoid logging sensitive information.
